# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains five projects completed for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** module during my 2nd year at **Sheffield Hallam University**. Each project demonstrates the application of algorithmic concepts, data structure design, and complexity analysis.

## Project 1: Algorithmic Complexity (10%)
- **Objective:** Calculate the computational complexity of a nested loop algorithm and represent it in Big-O notation.
- **Tasks:** 
  1. Determine algorithm complexity.
  2. Write a report on feedback response.
  3. Add solutions to the portfolio.

## Project 2: Data Structures for Dinner Plate Organisation (20%)
- **Objective:** Design and implement data structures to simulate a kitchen plate organisation system.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Design and manipulate data structures.
  2. Implement algorithms in C# or Java.
  3. Create a video presentation showcasing the program.
  4. Write a descriptive report.

## Project 3: Graph Manipulation Using Singly Linked Lists (20%)
- **Objective:** Design and manipulate graph structures using singly linked lists represented by DATA and LINK arrays.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Design data structures.
  2. Implement algorithms in C# or Java.
  3. Present a video showcasing the software.

## Project 4: Heuristic Algorithm Design for the Weights and Load Problem (20%)
- **Objective:** Design a heuristic algorithm (Hill Climbing) to solve the problem of equally distributing weights between two lorries.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Design a suitable data structure.
  2. Define and discuss the fitness function.
  3. Write pseudocode for the Hill Climbing algorithm.
  4. Discuss the small change strategy for the problem.

## Project 5: Hill Climbing Algorithm Experiments (30%)
- **Objective:** Implement and experiment with the Hill Climbing algorithm to solve the Weights and Load problem.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Implement the algorithm and run experiments.
  2. Analyse and report the results.
  3. Test the algorithm on a larger dataset.

Each project was graded based on algorithm design, data structure implementation, complexity analysis, and feedback incorporation.
